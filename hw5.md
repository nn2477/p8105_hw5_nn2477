## problem 1

importing & cleaning dataset

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (8): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_sex, city, stat...
    ## dbl (4): reported_date, victim_age, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

**description:** The resulting dataframe has 52178 entries, on variables
that include the victim name, race, age, and sex, reported homicide
date, and location of homicide. During my cleaning process, I created a
variable, `city_state`, that included both city and state and a
`resolution` variable to indicate if the case was closed via arrest. I
excluded Tulsa, AL as it is not a major US city and is most likely a
data entry error.

``` r
city_homicide_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"))
```

``` r
bmore_test = 
  prop.test(
    x = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
    n = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) 

broom::tidy(bmore_test) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
